Encountered Problems/Questions
1. SVG + g + path: using this combination of elements to introduce an icon has clear advantage over using a simple img element. As I do not know how to use the said element combo, I will use an img instead for now. *Learn how to use (svg + g + path) to improve scalability & customization. 

2. Adjusting the VH was a hassle for several reasons.

3. So, if an element is fixed, it overrides the element that wraps it, because the fixed element is fixed to the page, not to the element wrapping it. (This one took some time to sink in)
